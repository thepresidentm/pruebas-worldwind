                Space is a very dangerous place to be, there is no oxygen and no gravity however  humans are very curious and we like extreme challenges so, long ago we reached space but now we affront another challenge, our years of space exploration had involuntary results one of the most important of them is ‚ÄúSpace Junk‚Äù.

            <h2>Space Junk?</h2>
            <p>
                The most valuable tool for humans is our intelligence, we use knowlege to do the imposible, with knowlege we create specifiec tools to solve specific problems, we call these solutions tecnology, as you can imagine a human alone cannot reach the space but a group of humans with technology can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actually our thecnology is very complex but even today has problems like efficiency and control; the technology that we need to reach space produces junk and we live on a very complex world that even our best simulations of it aren't enough to predict everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the space junk comes from desintegration, explosion or colision of the approximately 8950 satelites put in orbit.

                Space isn't just an amazing place where nerds can imagine science fiction storties, actually we need space to do a lot of usefull things, like science, air traffic managment, or even Uber and Google Maps. Can you imagine a world without Google Maps? At least I can‚Äôt do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do anything on the space we need to put things in it, things like satelites or spaceships, you can imagine the space junk like a hailstorm, but instead of ice it has lots of metal pieces that could easily kill you, kill your dog and destroy your house.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="kesslerSyndrome">
            <h2>Kessler Syndrome</h2>
            <p>
                The Kessler Syndrome in a few words means ‚ÄúThe end of space‚Äù. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If even a piece of space junk just about 3 milimeters has the same energy than a bullet you can imagine what a bigger piece could do; space junk can destroy satelites, those destroyed satelites produce more space junk that can destroy another satelites, this could start a collision cascade where space junk produce more space junk, if this happens we could reach a point where putting anything on the space is basically imposible.
